The first line contains the following data:

	k M SD N C B E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 E8 E9 E10

Where
	k=20 
	M = number of tours
	SD = start day (from 0 to 6)
	N = number of vertices
	C = not relevant
	B = not relevant
	Ez = not relevant

The second line associates with start/end point (typically hotel):

	i x y d S 0 C

Where
	i = vertex number = 0
	x = x coordinate
	y = y coordinate
	d = visiting duration = 0	
	S = score of the location = 0
	O = opening of time window (start of the tour)
	C = closing of time window (end of the tour)
	

The remaining lines contain the data of each point. 
For each point, the line contains the following data:

	i x y d S t open[0] close[0] open[1] close[1] open[2] close[2] open[3] close[3] open[4] close[4] open[5] close[5] open[6] close[6] b

Where
	i = vertex number
	x = x coordinate
	y = y coordinate
	d = visiting duration	
	S = score of the location
	t = not relevant
	open[i] = the opening hour of the day i , i=0,1,2,3,4,5,6
	close[i] = the closing hour of the day i , i=0,1,2,3,4,5,6
	b = not relevant

* REMARKS *
	- The first point (vertex number 0) is the starting AND ending point.
	- The first regular point has vertex number 1. 
	- The time budget per path (Tmax) equals the closing time minus the starting time of the starting point.
	- The Euclidean distance is used and rounded down to the second decimal.
